    <h3>Annual Expected Benefit</h3>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 15px">Annual expected benefits from reefs for flood protection represents the predicted flooding avoided to land, people, and infrastructure by keeping coral reefs intact. It is an annualized benefit of the role of reefs in flood reduction that considers local factors such as reef condition, asset distribution, and storm frequency.</p>
    
    <h3>Benefits from Catastrophic Storms</h3>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 15px">30 years of historical data on regional sea level and wave conditions were used to develop a frequency distribution of storm sea levels and their intensity to estimate flooding for 1 in 10, 25, 50, and 100 year storm events.</p>

    <h3>People Protected</h3>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 15px">This value represents the difference of flooding impacts on people when coral reefs are present and when there is 1 meter of reef loss. This value is aggregated to the country scale from 90m resolution data.</p>

    <h3>Built Capital Protected</h3>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 15px">This value represents the difference of flooding impacts on built capital when coral reefs are present and when there is 1 meter of reef loss. This value is aggregated to the country scale from 90m resolution data.</p>

    <h3>Area Protected</h3>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 15px">This value represents the difference of flooding impacts on land area when coral reefs are present and when there is 1 meter of reef loss. This value is aggregated to the country scale from 90m resolution data.</p>
