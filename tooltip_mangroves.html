    <h3>Annual Expected Benefit</h3>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 20px">Annual expected benefits from mangroves for flood protection represents the predicted flood damages avoided to people and infrastructure by keeping mangroves intact. It is an annualized benefit metric that considers local factors such as mangrove presence, coastal topography, asset distribution, and storm frequency.</p>
    
    <h3>Benefits from Catastrophic Storms</h3>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 20px">>30 years of historical data on regional sea level, wave and storm conditions were used to develop a frequency distribution of storm water levels and their distribution, to estimate flooding for 1 in 25 and 1 in 50 year storm events.</p>
    
    <h3>People Protected</h3>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 20px">This value represents the difference of flooding impacts on people when mangroves are present and when they are absent. This value is aggregated to the country scale from 90m resolution data.</p>
    
    <h3>Built Capital Protected</h3>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 20px">This value represents the difference of flood impacts on built capital when mangroves are present and when they are absent. This value is aggregated to the country scale from 90m resolution data.</p>
